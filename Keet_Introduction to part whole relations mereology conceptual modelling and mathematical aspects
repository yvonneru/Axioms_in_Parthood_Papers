Introduction to part-whole relations: mereology, conceptual modelling and mathematical aspects
C. Maria Keet

part of(x,x) (1) // everything is part of itself

(part of(x,y)∧part of(y,x))→x=y (2) // two distinct things cannot be part of each other, or:
// if x is part of y and y is part of x, then x and y are the same thing

(part of(x,y)∧part of(y,z))→part of(x,z) (3) // if x is part of y and y is part of z, then x is part of z

proper part of(x,y)􏵒part of(x,y)∧¬part of(y,x) (4)
Six more predicates can be introduced, of which overlap (5) and overcross (7) tend to be more often mentioned, although underlap (6) is more often used in e.g. bio- ontologies.

overlap(x,y)􏵒∃z(part of(z,x)∧part of(z,y)) (5) // x and y ‘share’ a piece z (see also overcross); is reflexive and symmetric

underlap(x,y)􏵒∃z(part of(x,z)∧part of(y,z)) (6)
// x and y are both part of some z; is reflexive and symmetric

overcross(x,y)􏵒overlap(x,y)∧¬part of(x,y) (7) // x and y overlap, but x is not a part of y

undercross(x, y) 􏵒 underlap(x, y) ∧ ¬part of (y, x) (8) // x and y underlap, but y is not part of x

proper overlap(x, y) 􏵒 overcross(x, y) ∧ overcross(y, x) (9) // combines proper parthood with overlap

proper underlap(x, y) 􏵒 undercross(x, y) ∧ undercross(y, x) (10) // combines proper parthood with underlap

proper part of(x,y)→∃z(part of(z,y)∧¬overlap(z,x)) (11) // weak supplementation: every proper part must be supplemented by another, disjoint, part ¬part of(y,x)→∃z(part of(z,y)∧¬overlap(z,x)) (12)
// strong supplementation: if an object fails to include another among its parts, // then there must be a remainder
