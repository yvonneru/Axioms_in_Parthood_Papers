D1) Proper part. A proper part is a part that is other than the individual itself. For example, Spain is a proper part of EU, since Spain is part of EU and they are different entities.
D2) Direct part. X is a direct part of y if and only if x is a proper part of y and there is
no part between x and y 3 . For example, Italy is a direct part of EU, but Madrid is
TP PT
not, since Madrid is part of EU through Spain.
D3) Overlap. The relation overlap is defined as a sharing part. That is, x and y overlap if and only if there is a z such that z is part of x and part of y. For instance, Spain and Africa overlap, since Spain has territories in Africa (Canaries, Ceuta, Melilla, etc.).
D4) Underlap. The relation underlap is defined as a sharing whole. That is, x and y underlap if and only if there is a z such that x and y are parts of z. For example, Portugal, Spain, France and Italy underlap because they share a common whole: EU.
D5) Disjoint. The disjoint relation is the logical negation of overlaps. For example, EU and USA territories are disjoint.

D6) Binary sum. X + y is the z that fulfils that for all w’s , w overlaps z if and only if w overlaps x or w overlaps y. That is, x + y is the smallest object of which x and y are part.
D7) Binary product. X . y is the z that fulfils that for all w’s, w is part of z if and only if w is part of x and w is part of y. That is, X . y is the largest object that is part of x and y.

D8) General sum. The general sum of all x’s satisfying φ is that z that for every y, it overlaps z if and only if there is an x such that it satisfies φ and overlaps y. That is, the sum of φs is the entity that consists of all entities that satisfy φ.

D9) Atom. It is an element that does not have proper parts.
