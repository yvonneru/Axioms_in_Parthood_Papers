Axioms and basic definitions of Layered Mereology
*

(D1) PPxy =: Pxy & ∼Pyx (x is a proper part of y)
(D2) Oxy =: ∃z (Pzx & Pzy) (x and y overlap)
(D3) Uxy =: ∃z (Pxz & Pyz) (x and y underlap)
(D4) Lyz =: z􏱓x(Uxy)
(z is y’s layer: z is the sum of all objects that y underlaps)

*
Layers and maximal individuals
*

(D5) LYz =: ∃x Lxz (z is a layer)

(D6) MIz=:∀x(Oxz→Pxz)
(z is a maximal individual: for all x, if x overlaps z, then x is part of z)

*
Additional mereological relations
*

(D7) +(v,y,z)=:z􏱓x(Pxv∨Pxy) (z is the binary sum of v and y)
(D8) ×(v,y,z)=:z􏱓x(Pxv&Pxy) (z is the binary product of v and y)
(D9) −(v,y,z)=:z􏱓x(Pxy&∼Oxv) (z is the difference of v in y)
(D10) -(v,z)=:z􏱓x(Uxv&∼Oxv) (z is the relative complement of v)

The region function
***

(D11) Ry=:∃x(r(x)=y) (y is a region)

(D12) CCoin(x,y)=:r(x)=r(y) (x and y completely coincide)
(D13) Cov(x,y)=:Pr(x)r(y) (x is covered by y)
(D14) Coin(x,y)=:Or(x)r(y) (x and y coincide)

***
Layered Mereotopology
***

(D16) Mxy=:Cr(x)r(y)
(x and y meet: their regions are connected)
(D17) Axy=:ECr(x)r(y)
(x and y abut: their regions are externally connected)

(D18) TPxy =: Pxy & ∃z(Azx & Azy)
(x is a tangential part of y: x is part of y and 
there is some z such that z abuts both x and y)

(D19) IPxy=:Pxy&∼TPxy (x is an interior part of y)
It may be useful to add cross-layer counterparts of the tangential part and interior part relations:
(D20) TCov(x,y)=:TPr(x)r(y)
(x is t-covered by y: x’s region is a tangential part of y’s region)
(D21) ICov(x,y)=:IPr(x)r(y)
(x is i-covered by y: x’s region is an interior part of y’s region)

(D22) INT(y,z)=:z􏱓x(IPxy) (z is the interior of y)
