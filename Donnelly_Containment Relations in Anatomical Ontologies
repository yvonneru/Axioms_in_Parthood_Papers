Containment Relations in Anatomical Ontologies
Maureen Donnelly

Proper Parthood: x is a proper part of y if x is any part of y other than y itself. 
Symbolically:
PPxy =: Pxy & x ≠ y.

Overlap: x and y overlap if there is some object, z, that is part of both x and y. 
Symbolically: 
Oxy =: ∃z (Pzx & Pzy).

Region Containment: x is r-contained in y if x’s region is part of y’s region. 
Symbollically:
CNT-INrxy =: Pr(x)r(y).

Surround Containment: x is s-contained in y if x’s region is part of y’ s convex hull 
and x’ s region does not overlap y’ s region. 
Symbolically:
CNT-INsxy =: Pr(x)ch(y) & ∼Or(x)r(y)

General Containment: x is g-contained in y if x’s region is part of y’s convex hull. 
Symbolically:
CNT-INgxy =: Pr(x)ch(y).

Partial Containment x is partially contained in y if x’s region overlaps y’s convex hull. 
Symbolically:
P-CNT-INxy =: Or(x)ch(y).

Material-Region Containment: x is mr-contained in y 
if x is material, y is immaterial, and x’s region is part of y’s region. 
Symbolically:
CNT-INmrxy =: Mx & IMy & Pr(x)r(y).
