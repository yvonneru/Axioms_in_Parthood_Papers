Non-extensional temporal mereology

*
Time-dependent parthood relations among material objects
*

D: symmetric
all x all y all t (O(x,y,t) <-> (exists z(P(z,x,t) & P(z,y,t)))).

D: proper part at t, asymmetric
all x all y all t (PP(x,y,t) <-> (P(x,y,t) & (-(P(y,x,t))))).

D: x exists at t if and only if x is a part of itself at t
all x all t (E(x,t) <-> P(x,x,t)).

D: (meq, approximation equiv; meqt, approx equiv t) 
mereologically equivalent at t 
symmetric and transitive
iff x is a part of y at t and y is a part of x at t
all x all y (meq(x,y) <-> (P(x,y,t) & P(y,x,t))).

*
Contstant and bound parts
*

D: Object x is a constant part of object y if and only if whenever y exists, x is a part of y
reflexive and transitive.
all x all y (CP(x,y) <-> (all t(E(y,t) -> P(x,y,t)))).

D: Object x is a bound part of object y if and only whenever x exists, x is a part of y
reflexive and transitive.
all x all y (BP(x,y) <-> (all t(E(x,t) -> P(x,y,t)))).

Collections and time-dependent sums

*
Collections
*

D: subcollection: sub-collection, square supset
reflexive, antisymmetric, and transi- tive (a partial ordering)
in: belong
all p all q (subcollection(p,q) <-> (all x(in(x,p) -> in(x,q)))).

D: fp: a collection p is fully present at t if and only if all of its members exist at t
all p all t (FP(p,t) <-> (all x(in(x,p) -> E(x,t)))).

*
Time-dependent sums
*

D: object z is a sum of (the members of) the collection p at time t, SM zpt, 
if and only if p is fully present at t 
and any object overlaps z at t if and only if it overlaps a member of p at t
p sums to z at t or that z is a p-sum at t
all z all p all t (SM(z,p,t) <-> 
  (FP(p,t) & (all w(O(w,z,t) <-> (exists x(in(x,p) & O(x,w,t))))))).

***
Time-independent sums
***

*
Constant sums
*

D: Object x is a constant sum of collection p (a constant p-sum) 
if and only if whenever x exists, x is a sum of p
all x all p (SMC(x,p) <-> (all t(E(x,t) -> SM(x,p,t)))).

*
Bound sums
*

Object x is a bound sum of collection p (a bound p-sum) 
if and only if p is fully present at some time 
and at all times at which p is fully present x is a sum of p
all x all p (SMB(x,p) <-> (exists t(FP(p,t) & (all t(FP(p,t) -> SM(x,p,t)))))).

*
Permanent sums
*

Object x is a permanent sum of collection p (a permanent p-sum) 
if and only if x is both a constant p-sum and a bound p-sum
all x all p (SMP(x,p) <-> (SMC(x,p) & SMB(x,p))).
